# PlayerTrack
[![Build plugin](https://github.com/kalilistic/PlayerTrack/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kalilistic/PlayerTrack/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Dalamud plugin to keep track of players you meet in FFXIV.

PlayerTrack helps you keep a record of who you meet and the content you played together. By default, this is instanced content only - but you can expand or restrict this in settings. You can see all the details on a player by clicking on their name in the overlay. Here you can also record notes and set a personalized icon/color. PlayerTrack uses Lodestone to keep the data updated (e.g. world transfers). If this happens, you'll see an indicator next to their home world and can mouse-over to see their previous residence.
